# Obesity Prediction Models

This repository contains implementations of **Decision Tree** and **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)** models to estimate obesity levels based on eating habits and physical condition. The models were developed and evaluated using the **‘Estimation of Obesity Levels Based On Eating Habits and Physical Condition’** dataset.

## Project Overview

The objective of this project is to:
- Analyze eating habits and physical activity data.
- Predict obesity levels using machine learning models.
- Compare the performance of Decision Tree and KNN models.

Each model is provided as a Jupyter Notebook, showcasing the workflow from data preprocessing to evaluation.

## Models Implemented

### 1. Decision Tree
- **Description**: A classification model that uses a tree-like structure to make decisions based on feature values.
- **Key Features**:
  - Handles categorical and numerical features effectively.
  - Provides interpretable results for decision-making.

### 2. K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
- **Description**: A non-parametric algorithm that predicts the class of a sample based on its closest neighbors in the feature space.
- **Key Features**:
  - Simple yet effective for classification problems.
  - Performance heavily depends on the choice of `k` and distance metric.
